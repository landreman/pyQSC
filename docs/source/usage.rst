Usage
===============


Known configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``pyQSC`` has several built-in stellarator configurations that can be called
using the function ``from_paper``. For example, if we wanted to use the
second order configuration from section 5.2 of [LandremanSengupta]_, we
can simply call

.. code-block::

   from qsc import Qsc
   stel = Qsc.from_paper('r2 section 5.2')

pyQSC has all the first order configurations from [LandremanSenguptaPlunk]_,
all the second order configurations from [LandremanSengupta]_ and the precise
quasisymmetric configurations of [LandremanPaul]_. The first and second order
configurations are labeled as ``rX section 5.Y`` where ``X`` is the order and
``Y`` is the subsection of the paper, while the precise quasisymmetric configurations
are labeled ``QA``, ``QA+well``, ``QH`` or ``QH+well``.
Alternatively, a configuration generated by the `C++ version of QSC <https://github.com/landreman/qsc>`_ can be obtained
using the function

.. code-block::

   from qsc import Qsc
   stel = Qsc.from_cxx(filename)

where ``filename`` is the output file of the C++ version of QSC.


New configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A minimal quasisymmetric configuration can be created using the following four parameters:
the cosine components of the axis radial component ``rc``, the sine components of the axis
vertical component ``zs``, the number of field periods ``nfp`` and the scalar parameter ``etabar``
for the first order magnetic field.
The following example creates the ``r1 section 5.1`` configuration using only these four
parameters:

.. code-block::

   from qsc import Qsc
   stel = Qsc(rc=[1, 0.045], zs=[0, -0.045], nfp=3, etabar=-0.9)

The following example creates the second order configuration of ``r2 section 5.4``.
As a second order configuration, besides the first order input parameters, it needs to be
specified as ``order="r2"``, and it takes one more input parameter: the scalar parameter
``B2c`` for the second order magnetic field.

.. code-block::

   from qsc import Qsc
   stel = Qsc(rc=[1, 0.155, 0.0102], zs=[0, 0.154, 0.0111], nfp=2, etabar=0.64, order='r2', B2c=-0.00322)

In the examples above, only stellarator-symmetric configurations in vacuum are created. The extra parameters
in pyQSC that need to be specified for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations are specified in
`Input parameters`_. For a configuration with finite toroidal current on-axis, you can specify the
parameter ``I2`` (the second derivative of the current with respect to the radial variable ``r``).
Also, at second order, it is possible to specify a value for ``p2``
(the second derivative of the pressure with respect to the radial variable ``r``, usually negative)
therefore creating a finite-:math:`\beta` configuration. The resolution used in pyQSC is controlled
using the parameter ``nphi`` which is set by default as ``nphi=61``.


Simple Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^

In this Demo, we create a second order configuration and evaluate a few of its parameters.
We also plot a surface shape at a constant toroidal magnetic flux (flux surface) and plot
many of the relevant parameters for the near-axis construction. The file associated with
this Demo is located in the ``examples`` folder.

.. code-block::

   from qsc import Qsc
   import numpy as np
   stel = Qsc(rc=[1, 0.09], zs=[0, -0.09], nfp=2, etabar=0.95, I2=0.9, order='r2', B2c=-0.7, p2=-600000.)
   print(stel.iota) # Rotational transform on-axis for this configuration
   print(stel.d2_volume_d_psi2) # Magnetic well V''(psi)
   print(stel.DMerc_times_r2) # Mercier criterion parameter DMerc multiplied by r^2
   print(stel.min_L_grad_B) # Scale length associated with the grad grad B tensor
   print(stel.grad_grad_B_inverse_scale_length) # Scale length associated with the grad grad B tensor
   stel.plot_boundary() # Plot the flux surface shape at the default radius r = 0.1
   stel.plot() # Plot relevant near axis parameters


Input parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Besides the input parameters of ``pyQSC`` listed above, there are other input parameters
related to stellarator-symmetry and to the choice of vacuum or non-vacuum configurations.
By order of appearance in the ``Qsc`` function, the possible input parameters to pyQSC are:

- rc: the cosine components of the axis radial component
- zs: the sine components of the axis vertical component
- rs: the sine components of the axis radial component
- zc: the cosine components of the axis vertical component
- nfp: the number of field periods
- etabar: a scalar that specifies the strength of the first order magnetic field modulus
- sigma0: the value of the function sigma at phi=0, which is 0 for stellarator-symmetry
- B0: the strength of the magnetic field on-axis
- I2: the second derivative of the current with respect to the radial variable ``r``
- sG: sign of the Boozer function G
- spsi: sign of the toroidal flux function Psi
- nphi: toroidal resolution specifying the number of points in a grid along the axis
- B2s: a scalar that specifies the strength of the sine component of the second order magnetic field modulus, 0 for stellarator-symmetry
- B2c: a scalar that specifies the strength of the cosine component of the second order magnetic field modulus
- p2: the second derivative of the pressure with respect to the radial variable ``r``, usually negative
- order: a string that specifies the order of the expansion, "r1", "r2" or "r3". For "r3" only the X3c1, Y3c1 and Y3s1 components are calculated (see section 3 of [LandremanSengupta]_)


Using with SIMSOPT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example of the usage of ``pyQsc`` with the optimization code ``SIMSOPT`` is shown
in the examples folder in the file ``simsopt_demo.py``.
